# Intro

Some HTML attribute names (like `class` ou `for`) are also Javascript reserved keywords. When transpiling from **JSX** to **Javascript** those attributes would generate invalid Javascript. 

Because of that, React has some special attributes that are then mapped to the equivalents on HTML. Ex: `htmlFor` -> `for`;

You can check a [list of HTML attributes that React supports](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html#html-elements).
